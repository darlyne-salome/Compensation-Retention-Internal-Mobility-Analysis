# Compensation-Retention-Internal-Mobility-Analysis
A data-driven analysis of employee retention, compensation equity, and internal mobility using SQL, Excel, and Python. Key insights were visualized to reveal turnover patterns, gender pay gaps, and promotion trends across departments and job levels.

# Objective
To analyze employee data to uncover insights around compensation fairness, turnover patterns, and promotion trends across departments and job levels.

# Files Included
- 'enhanced_hr_data.xlsx' - Contains cleaned dataset, pivot tables, and key visuals
- 'hr_data_columns.py' - Python script used to enhance original dataset with new columns
- 'hr_data_report.txt' - Contains the analysis report
- 'hr_data_db.sqbpro' - contains the loaded dataset and sql queries
- 'hr_data_db.db' - contains the loaded dataset
- 'hr_data' - contains the original data from Kaggle

# Key Insights
- **HR department** has the highest turnover rate (29%), while **Management** has the lowest (14%).
- **Mid-level employees** show significantly lower retention (80%) compared to **entry-level** (97%).
- Employees **who were promoted** had a turnover rate of just **0.3%**, versus **24%** among those not promoted.
- **Men are paid more than women** in most departments, except for **HR and Technical**.
- The average time before a promotion is **4.2 years**, indicating a slow career progression cycle.

# Tools Used
- **Excel**: Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, Bar Charts
- **SQL (SQLite)**: For data queries and exploration
- **Python**: Data enhancement (`hr_data_columns.py`)

# Visuals
All visuals (bar charts and tables) are embedded in the 'enhanced_hr_data.xlsx' file under the 'Visuals' sheet.

# Summary
The analysis reveals gaps in internal mobility and pay equity, and suggests that increasing promotion opportunities and addressing mid-level attrition could improve retention and engagement.
